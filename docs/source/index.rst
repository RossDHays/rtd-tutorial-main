Welcome to ORCA documentation
===================================

``ORCA`` (*Optimization of Real-time Capacity Allocation* ) is a modeling toolset to accelerate real-time control and optimization of digital twins, including virtual models of facilities, physical facilities, and interconnections to allow optimal control of physical facilities using virtual models. ORCA is enabled by Idaho National Laboratory's `RAVEN <https://github.com/idaholab/raven>`_ and `DeepLynx <https://github.com/idaholab/Deep-Lynx>`_ software codes.

This page contains various quick links and indices to relevant parts of the documentation.
